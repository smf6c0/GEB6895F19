# Example 1 Write an R function that reads two numbers, multiplies them together and prints out their
# product. You could start out with multiply two <- function(num 1, num 2) f ... g.

multiply_two<-function(num_1, num_2)
  
{
  return(num_1*num_2)
}

# Example 2 Write an R function that tells a user that the number they entered is not a 5 or a 6. You can
# read input from the keyboard with num in <- readline(prompt="Enter a number: ").


# Example 3 Write an R function that performs the following: Ask a user to enter a number. If the number
# is between 0 and 10, write the word blue. If the number is between 10 and 20, write the word
# red. If the number is between 20 and 30, write the word green. If it is any other number,
# write that it is not a correct color option.
 
 
# Example 4 Write an R function to print all multiples of 5 between 1 and n (possibly including n).
 
 
# Example 5 Write an R function that will count all the even numbers up to a user denied stopping point.

# Example 6 Write an R function that will perform the following.
# a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
# b) Calculate the average of the ve numbers.
# c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the ve entered numbers.
# d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing the results,
# i.e. maximum is ....
